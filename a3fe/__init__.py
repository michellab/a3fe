Automated Adaptive Absolute alchemical Free Energy calculator. A package for running
adaptive alchemical absolute binding free energy calculations with SOMD
(distributed within sire(https://sire.openbiosim.org/)) using adaptive
protocols based on an ensemble of simulations. This requires the SLURM scheduling
system. Please see the documentation (https://a3fe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).
